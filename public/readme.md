# Automagical `public` directory

The `public` directory is a great place to add (compiled) JS and CSS, images, gifs, or any other files you want to publicly accessible.

Each time your app deploys, the contents of this folder will automatically be published to your origin and CDN.

Learn more about working with [static assets here](https://docs.begin.com/en/getting-started/static-assets/).


## Use caution!

The full contents of this folder (`public/`) will be copied to a publicly accessible destination with each deploy. It will overwrite any existing files with the same name.


## Note

You should feel free to delete this file and directory!
